	<h1>Hi Max,</h1>
	<section>
	<ul>
	<li>Because I found the header difficult, I did the assignment "Gregslist" three ways. The course said not to use floats except when wrapping text, but I can't figure out a solution with inline-block. <br>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="absolute.html">Absolute positioning on the logo</a></li>
		<li><a href="float.html">Floating the nav to the right</a></li>
		<li><a href="inline.html">Display inline-block</a>, which doesn't work.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I am also having trouble with table borders (I know they should be gray, they are red sometimes because I was testing how they work). Can't get border-collapse to work with border-radius, so a gap appears between td borders and table.</li>
	<li>Because the star appears on every search result I chose to use the ::before selector, but the star changes color when any part of the assocaited li element is hovered. Rather than copy in the star element on every li with a class to isolate its hover behavior I would choose to use jQuery in this situation. </li>
	</ul>
